# Have you heard of the [Monty Hall Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)?
I decided to check it out for myself and wrote this short program. If you want too, use:
```
ruby monty_hall_app.rb
```
or just
```
monty_hall_app.rb
```
But don't forget to change the file permissions:
```
chmod 755 monty_hall_app.rb
```
To make sure Monty isn't lying to us, install [RSpec](http://github.com/rspec) and run tests
```
bundle
rspec
```
Good luck!
